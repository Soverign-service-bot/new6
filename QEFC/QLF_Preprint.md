# **Sovereign-Engine: A Multiverse-Based Quaternary Logic Framework and ELO-Driven Logical Evolution**  
### *Extended Abstract / Preprint Version 1.0*

## **Abstract**
This paper presents *Sovereign-Engine*, a multiverse logic simulation system designed to evaluate and evolve alternative truth systems under the **Quaternary Logic Framework (QLF)**, consisting of {T, C, N, F}. Each “universe” defines a unique rule set governing the interaction of truth values. We introduce a benchmark suite for measuring logical consistency and a novel **ELO-based evolution mechanism**—treating logical universes as competitive agents. Results demonstrate clear differentiation in universe fitness and reveal emergent properties in truth synthesis across heterogeneous logical contexts.

## **1. Introduction**
Classical binary logic is insufficient for modeling contradiction-tolerant, indeterminate, and multi-context reasoning. QLF extends truth representation to four values:
- **T** (True)  
- **C** (Contradictory True)  
- **N** (Neutral / Indeterminate)  
- **F** (False)

To explore the behavior of systems governed by QLF operators, we introduce a *multiverse simulation paradigm*: each universe implements distinct operator definitions for `C+C`, `F+T`, etc. Sovereign-Engine provides a computational environment for analyzing, comparing, and evolving these logical systems.

---

## **2. Quaternary Logic Framework (QLF)**
Each universe defines operator outcomes as:


C + C → {T,C,N,F}
N + T → {T,C,N,F}
F + T → {T,C,N,F}
F + C → {T,C,N,F}


This formulation supports diverse logical regimes:
- contradiction-dominant universes  
- neutrality-preferred universes  
- truth-amplifying universes  
- decay-to-false universes  

---

## **3. Multiverse Logic Model**
A universe acts as a *Logic State Machine*, mapping input pairs to new truth states. Comparative analysis is performed through:

1. **Consistency Metrics**  
2. **Truth-space coverage**  
3. **Conflict resolution ability**  
4. **Stability under iterative application**  

This constitutes the benchmark score.

---

## **4. ELO-Based Logical Evolution**
Inspired by competitive games, universes engage in pairwise contests. Each match tests their ability to produce more coherent outputs across identical queries. Updates follow:

\[
E = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{(Δ/400)}}
\]

\[
R_{new} = R_{old} + K(S - E)
\]

Higher ELO universes demonstrate more stable logical behavior and more expressive truth dynamics.

---

## **5. Results**
Benchmarking eight universes shows a clear separation of logical performance. Universe 6 and 8 dominate with scores 34 and 27, while Universe 3 collapses to –4 due to excessive degeneracy. ELO tournaments similarly produce a stable hierarchy (1049 → 934).

---

## **6. Discussion**
The emergence of logical dominance suggests that truth systems can undergo *Darwinian selection*. Contradiction-tolerant universes outperform brittle falsity-dominant ones. These findings imply new directions for:

- paraconsistent logic  
- non-classical truth modeling  
- AI reasoning under ambiguity  
- multi-context logic architectures  

---

## **7. Conclusion**
Sovereign-Engine establishes a foundation for studying the evolution of logic itself. QLF's four-value system, combined with a multiverse simulation and ELO competitive dynamics, creates a new experimental platform for non-classical logic research.
