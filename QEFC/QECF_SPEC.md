# Quaternary Epistemic Control Framework (QECF)
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Frozen Boundary  
**Architect:** Dinooo1999

## 1. Abstract
QECF is a meta-logical architecture designed to address the structural limitations of contemporary logic systems—specifically the lack of a formal mechanism for **Voluntary Withdrawal** from inference without forced resolution.

## 2. The Four Epistemic States
Unlike binary or fuzzy logic, QECF introduces a fourth operational-epistemic state:

1.  **Assertion (T):** System accepts the proposition.
2.  **Denial (F):** System rejects the proposition (Noise/Error).
3.  **Suspension (N):** System delays judgment (Null/Potential).
4.  **Withdrawal (W):** System exits the inference process intentionally to maintain sovereignty and internal consistency. **(The Quaternary State)**

## 3. Necessary and Sufficient Conditions
A system attains "Quaternary" status only if it meets these three criteria:

* **N1. Irreversibility:** The withdrawal state (w) cannot be reversed by the Inference Engine.
* **N2. Asymmetric Authority:** The Inference Engine has no write-access to the Supervisor's state.
* **N3. Temporal Decoupling:** The Supervisor operates on a separate clock domain or event-trigger.

           |             enforced override (Withdrawal)          |
           +-----------------------------------------------------+
                         (No write-back path from I to Q)

## 5. Implementation in Sovereign-Engine
The Sovereign-Engine realizes QECF through the **Quaternary Logic Framework (QLF)** core, where the `N` and `C` states in our 4x4 matrices function as the mathematical representation of **Withdrawal** and **Tension**, preventing the system from falling into infinite regress or forced binary resolution.
